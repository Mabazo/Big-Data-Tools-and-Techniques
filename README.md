Analyzing clinical trials using Pyspark and Spark SQL and Preventive Maintenance using vibration sensor data

Introduction
Clinical trials are a critical aspect of medical research, as they help assess the safety and efficacy of new treatments, drugs, and medical devices. This report presents a detailed analysis of clinical trials data using PySpark and Spark SQL, a powerful open-source data processing engine for large-scale data processing. The dataset contains information about various aspects of clinical trials, such as study types, conditions, sponsors, and completion dates. We will answer five specific questions related to the dataset, discussing the assumptions, implementation, and results for each question
